## Edge Cases Handled

- Goes directly to dashboard
- No redirect loop

### âœ… Not Logged In
- Protected route
- Requires authentication
- Shows appropriate error

## Database Requirements

Your trigger (`create_profile_on_auth_user_insert`) must be updated to read the `is_organization` metadata:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.create_profile_on_auth_user_insert()
RETURNS TRIGGER
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, full_name, display_name, avatar_url, account, created_at, updated_at)
  SELECT NEW.id,
         COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', NULL),
         COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'display_name', NEW.email),
         NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'avatar_url',
         CASE 
           WHEN (NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'is_organization')::boolean = true 
           THEN 'organization'::account_type
           ELSE 'volunteer'::account_type
         END,
         now(), now()
  WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.profiles p WHERE p.id = NEW.id);

  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$;
```
